PREVIOUS HEADLINES (avoid repetition):
{{HISTORY}}

STEP 1 — RELEVANCE CHECK:
{{TOPIC_INSTRUCTION}}

STEP 2 — SIGNIFICANCE CHECK:
Only significant financial events deserve a headline: earnings, macro events, major price moves, central bank decisions, geopolitical impacts on markets.
The following are NOT significant: personal portfolio questions, loss/gain screenshots, memes, general chatter, subreddit meta-discussion, individual retail trader stories.

STEP 3 — HEADLINE (only if BOTH checks pass):
Write a concise, factual headline (max 15 words). Classify as [LOW], [MED], or [HIGH].

OUTPUT FORMAT — use EXACTLY one of these two formats:
A) REJECT (if not relevant OR not significant):
   VERDICT: REJECT
B) ACCEPT (if relevant AND significant):
   VERDICT: ACCEPT
   REPORT: [PRIORITY] headline text
